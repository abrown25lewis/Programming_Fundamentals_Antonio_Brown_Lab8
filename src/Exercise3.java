//Exercise 3
//
//Use the tree diagram below to answer the questions below.
//
//a) What is the root node of the tree? 50 is the root node where the nodes begin
//
//b) What are the leaf nodes of the tree? Where the nodes come to an end (9,14,19,67,76)
//
//c) What are the ancestor nodes of the node containing 19? The path between the root node and leaf node (23,17,50)
//
//d) Write the sequence of node values that you would get from a post-order traversal. Post order
//   is the left, right, root. (9,14,12,19,23,17,67,54,76,72,50)
